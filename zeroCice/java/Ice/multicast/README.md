This demo illustrates how to use [UDP multicast][1] to implement a
discovery service.

To run the demo, first start multiple instances of the server:

```
java -jar build/libs/server.jar
```

In a separate window, start a client:

```
java -jar build/libs/client.jar
```

On startup the client will send out a broadcast message containing a
callback proxy and waits for a response. Any servers that are up and
listening on the broadcast port will then contact the client using the
callback saying they are available. The client selects a server and
proceeds.

By default this demo uses IPv4. If you want to use IPv6 UDP multicast
instead, uncomment the alternative IPv6 configuration in `config.client`
and `config.server`.
