This demo illustrates how to [interrupt][1] blocking servant dispatches on
the server and interrupt blocking proxy invocations on the client by
using `Thread.interrupt()`.

To run the demo, first start the server:

```
java -jar build/libs/server.jar
```

In a separate window, start the client:

```
java -jar build/libs/client.jar
```

Calling `TaskManager.run` on the server simulates a long running task
by sleeping 10 seconds. Ordinarily a server will not shutdown until
all executing dispatched requests are complete. By interrupting
dispatch threads using `Thread.interrupt()` a server shutdown will
proceed, as long as the servant implementation correctly handles the
interrupt.

The simplest way to interrupt dispatch threads is by using an
`Ice.Dispatcher` and `ExecutorService`. Calling shutdownNow on the
ExecutorService interrupts any executing tasks.

Pressing ^C in the server calls shutdownNow on the executor service,
as does pressing 's' in the client which calls `TaskManager.shutdown`,
the implementation of which itself calls shutdownNow.

It is also possible to interrupt blocking invocations on an Ice proxy
by calling `Thread.interrupt()`.

In this demo, to interrupt a blocking proxy invocation on the client
press 'b' to run the invocation and 'i' to interrupt the invocation.
Only a single blocking invocation can be active at once.

Pressing 't' in the client runs the task on the server using a
non-blocking AMI invocation.
