This demo demonstrates the use of [Glacier2 session helpers][1] and Swing
to create a graphical client for the simple chat server.

First follow the instructions in the C++ Glacier2 simpleChat demo
README to start the server and the Glacier2 router.

In a separate window, start the swing client:

```
java -jar build/libs/client.jar
```
