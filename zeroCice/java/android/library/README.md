This directory contains an Android Studio project for the library client.

The library client is an example of an Android front-end for an
enterprise-style application. It allows you to query and manipulate
a library of books by issuing Ice invocations to a remote server
implemented using a database.

Like the chat client, this program defaults to a ZeroC-hosted server
on "demo2.zeroc.com". If you prefer, you can run your own library
server; the Java source code for this server can be found in the
Database/library subdirectory.

Refer to the [java README.md](../../README.md) for build instructions.
