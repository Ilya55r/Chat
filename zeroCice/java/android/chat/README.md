This directory contains an Android Studio project for the chat client.

The chat client provides Android devices with native access to our
sample chat system. This client demonstrates several useful techniques
that are instructive for Android developers:

 * Issuing asynchronous Ice invocations to maintain a responsive user
   interface
 * Using Glacier2 and bidirectional connections to receive "push
   notifications" from a remote server
 * Proper separation of UI and application logic

By default the client uses "demo.zeroc.com" as its server, which
refers to the public chat server hosted by ZeroC. For more information
about the chat system, or to download the source code for the chat
system so that you can run your own server, please visit the link

Refer to the [java README.md](../../README.md) for build instructions.
