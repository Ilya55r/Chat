This directory contains an Android Studio project for the hello client.

The hello client is the Android equivalent of our command-line demo
of the same name. There are two ways you can use this app:

1. Start an Ice/hello server from any language mapping and enter the
server's host name or IP address in the app's "Host" field.

2. Start an IceDiscovery/hello server from any language mapping and
check the "Use IceDiscovery" box. Note that multicast is not supported
in the emulator so this app must be installed on a device in order to
use [IceDiscovery][1].

Refer to the README file in the server's directory for more information
on starting the server.

Refer to the [java README.md](../../README.md) for build instructions.
